I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in the Decision, Risk, and Operations (DRO) division at Columbia Business School, where I am fortunate to be advised by Hongyao Ma and Will Ma.

My research interests center on algorithmic decision-making under uncertainty, combining application-specific design with theoretical performance guarantees to improve the operations of digital marketplaces such as on-demand delivery platforms.
